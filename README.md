## Instructions
### Adding a Thumbnail element
> We know, this is not the most user friendly solution. Maybe in the future we'ill make a more elegant solution

The sheer amount of thumbnails is quite annoying to create and maintain in static HTML. Therefore this project creates these elements dynamicially. To add/edit a thumbnail to the page, use the following steps:
1. Put your thumbnail-image into the static/img folder.
2. in the JS folder go to data.js. [Create a new element](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp) within this object with the name 'item + theAmountOfElements + 1'.
